# The Chi-square Distribution Continued

In the previous section we introduced the `chi-square` distribution as a sum of squared normal standard random variables. We illustrated how to generate `1000` chi-square random variables to approximate the chi-square distribution.

In this section we increase the number of observation to better approximate the shape of the chi-square distribution.

## Problem 1: Simulating random chi-square variables 1 DOF (4000 samples)

Let's study first the simple case of `v=1`.

- X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>

In this section, weâ€™ll show you how to generate **4000** `chi-square` random variables by squaring random standard normal variables.

First, generate `4000` random values in the range `[1 1,000,000]`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,1000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT *
  FROM samples
 ORDER BY id;
```

Next, randomly select `with replacement` 4000 observations from a standard normal distribution and squared the result.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,4000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT  ob_id
      , z
      , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
INNER JOIN samples s
   ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
ORDER BY chi_sq_x,z,ob_id;
```

Let's save the `chi-square` distribution with one degree of freedom.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE chi_squared_dof1 AS (
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,4000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
chi_squared_samples AS (
  SELECT  z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
)
SELECT chi_sq_x
  FROM chi_squared_samples
);

WITH diff AS (
  SELECT chi_sq_x AS x
       , COUNT(chi_sq_x) OVER() AS n
       , AVG(chi_sq_x) OVER() AS mean
       , STDDEV_POP(chi_sq_x) OVER() AS std_p
       , STDDEV(chi_sq_x) OVER() AS std
    FROM chi_squared_dof1
),

  SELECT n
       , PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP(ORDER BY x) AS median
       , mean
       , std
       , SUM(POWER(x - mean,3))/(COUNT(x))  AS num_sk
       , POWER(std_p,3) AS den_sk
       , SUM(POWER(x - mean,4))/(COUNT(x))  AS num_krt
       , POWER(std_p,4) AS den_krt
    FROM diff
   GROUP BY n, mean, std, std_p
),
pop_sk_krt AS (
  SELECT  n
        , median
        , mean
        , std
        , num_sk/den_sk AS skw
        , num_krt/den_krt - 3 AS execess_krt
    FROM comp_sk_krt
)
SELECT 'n' AS stats
      , n AS emp_val
      , n AS theo_val
  FROM pop_sk_krt
UNION ALL
SELECT 'mean' AS stats
      , ROUND(mean::NUMERIC,2) AS emp_val

  FROM pop_sk_krt
UNION ALL
SELECT 'sample_std' AS stats
      , ROUND(std,2) AS emp_val
      , ROUND(SQRT(2*1.0)::NUMERIC,2) AS theo_val
  FROM pop_sk_krt
UNION ALL
SELECT 'sample_skw' AS stats
      , ROUND((SQRT(n*(n-1.0))/(n-2.0))*skw,2) AS emp_val
      , ROUND(SQRT(8/1.0)::NUMERIC,2) AS theo_val
  FROM pop_sk_krt
UNION ALL
SELECT 'ex_kurt' AS stats
      , ROUND((n - 1)*((n + 1)*execess_krt + 6)/((n-2)*(n-3)),2) AS emp_val
      , ROUND((12/1.0)::NUMERIC,2) AS theo_val
  FROM pop_sk_krt;
```

```console
stats      | emp_val | theo_val
-----------+---------+----------
n          |    4000 |     4000
mean       |    1.01 |      1.0

sample_skw |    2.75 |     2.83
ex_kurt    |   10.30 |    12.00
```

Let's plot the histogram:


```SQL
WITH chi_squared_cnt AS (
  SELECT chi_sq_x
       , COUNT(chi_sq_x) AS cnt

   GROUP BY 1

               THEN (FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER - 1) + 1
               ELSE FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER + 1
          END AS id
         ,CASE WHEN chi_sq_x <= 1
              THEN '(0 1]'
              WHEN FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER = CEIL(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER
              THEN '(' || (FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER - 1)::TEXT || ' ' ||  (FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER)::TEXT || ']'

## Problem 2: Simulating random chi-square variables 2 DOF (4000 samples)

Let's study the case of `v=2`.

- X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>

Randomly select two observations from a standard normal distribution with a mean zero and standard deviation  of 1. Next, square each value and sum them all up. The result is an observation from a `chi-square` distribution with `2` degree of freedom.

First, generate `8000` random values in the range `[1 1,000,000]`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,8000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT *
  FROM samples
 ORDER BY id;
```

Next, randomly select `with replacement` 8000 observations from a standard normal distribution and squared the result.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,8000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT  s.id
      , z
      , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
INNER JOIN samples s
   ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
ORDER BY id;
```

Next, partition the table rows in 4000 groups of two samples.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,8000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
)
SELECT  NTILE (4000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
      , id
      , z
      , chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_sampling
ORDER BY id;
```

```console
grp  |  id  |   z   | chi_sq_x
-----+------+-------+----------
   1 |    1 | -0.10 |     0.01
   1 |    2 | -0.40 |     0.16
   2 |    3 |  0.10 |     0.01
   2 |    4 | -0.40 |     0.16
```

Let's create a table with the random variables.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE chi_squared_dof2 AS (

```

```console

```

Let's plot the histogram:


```SQL

## Problem 2: Simulating random chi-square variables 3 DOF (4000 samples)

Let's study the case of `v=3`.

- X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>

Randomly select three observations from a standard normal distribution with a mean zero and standard deviation  of 1. Next, square each value and sum them all up. The result is an observation from a `chi-square` distribution with `3` degree of freedom.


Partition the table rows in `4000` groups of `3` samples. We need `12,000` samples.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *

),

  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z

   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
)
SELECT  NTILE (4000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
      , id
      , z
      , chi_sq_x

ORDER BY id;
```

```console

## Problem 4: Simulating random chi-square variables 4 DOF

Let's study the case of `v=4`.

- X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>4</sub>

Randomly select four observations from a standard normal distribution with a mean zero and standard deviation  of 1. Next, square each value and sum them all up. The result is an observation from a `chi-square` distribution with `4` degree of freedom.

Partition the table rows in `4000` groups of `4` samples. We need `16,000` samples.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,16000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
)
SELECT  NTILE (4000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
      , id
      , z
      , chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_sampling
ORDER BY id;
```

```console
grp  |  id   |   z   | chi_sq_x
-----+-------+-------+----------
   1 |     1 | -1.00 |     1.00
   1 |     2 | -0.50 |     0.25
   1 |     3 | -0.30 |     0.09
   1 |     4 | -1.90 |     3.61
   2 |     5 | -2.70 |     7.29
   2 |     6 | -0.40 |     0.16

Let's create a table with the random variables.
