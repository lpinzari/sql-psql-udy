# The Chi-square Distribution

The Chi-square distribution results when `v` independent variables with standard normal distribution are squared and summed:

Let `v` be the number of independent variables with standard normal distribution X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>v</sub> with mean (mu = 0) and standard deviation (sigma = 1), then the chi-square random variable distribution is:

- X<sup>2</sup> =  X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> + ... + X<sup>2</sup><sub>v</sub>.

## Problem 1: Simulating random chi-square variables 1 DOF

Let's study first the simple case of `v=1`.

- X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub>

In this section, weâ€™ll show you how to generate **1000** `chi-square` random variables by squaring random standard normal variables.

1. Generate `1,000,000` random standard variables z.


```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE normal AS (
  SELECT '(-inf -4.7]' AS bin
        , -4.75 AS z_inf
        , -4.8 AS z
        , (pnorm(-4.7)::NUMERIC(7,6)*1000000)::INTEGER AS freq
  UNION ALL
  SELECT '(' || z_inf::TEXT || ' ' || (z_inf + 0.1)::TEXT || ']'
        , z_inf + 0.1 AS z_inf
        , z_inf + 0.05 AS z
        , CASE WHEN z = 4.7
               THEN  (((1 - pnorm(z))::NUMERIC(7,6))*1000000)::INTEGER
               ELSE
              ((pnorm(z_inf + 0.1)::NUMERIC(7,6) - pnorm(z_inf)::NUMERIC(7,6))*1000000)::INTEGER
          END AS freq
    FROM normal
   WHERE z <= 4.7
)
 SELECT  z
       , freq
   FROM normal
  ORDER BY 1;
```

```console

```

Let's save the query as a view.

```SQL
CREATE VIEW normal_z_1M AS (
WITH RECURSIVE normal AS (
  SELECT '(-inf -4.7]' AS bin
        , -4.75 AS z_inf
        , -4.8 AS z
        , (pnorm(-4.7)::NUMERIC(7,6)*1000000)::INTEGER AS freq
  UNION ALL
  SELECT '(' || z_inf::TEXT || ' ' || (z_inf + 0.1)::TEXT || ']'
        , z_inf + 0.1 AS z_inf
        , z_inf + 0.05 AS z
        , CASE WHEN z = 4.7
               THEN  (((1 - pnorm(z))::NUMERIC(7,6))*1000000)::INTEGER
               ELSE
              ((pnorm(z_inf + 0.1)::NUMERIC(7,6) - pnorm(z_inf)::NUMERIC(7,6))*1000000)::INTEGER
          END AS freq
    FROM normal
   WHERE z <= 4.7
)
 SELECT  z
       , freq
   FROM normal
  ORDER BY 1
);
```


Let's expand the frequency vector to a vector of `1,000,000` zscore observation values.


```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE duplicate_val AS (
  SELECT *
    FROM normal_z_1M
   UNION ALL
  SELECT v.z AS z
        , v.freq - 1 AS freq
    FROM duplicate_val v
   INNER JOIN normal_z_1M w
      ON v.z = w.z
   WHERE v.freq > 1
)
SELECT *
  FROM duplicate_val
 ORDER BY z, freq;
```

```console
z     | freq
------+-------
-4.8  |     1
-4.70 |     1
-4.60 |     1
-4.50 |     1
-4.40 |     1
-4.40 |     2
-4.40 |     3
-4.30 |     1
-4.30 |     2
-4.30 |     3
-4.30 |     4
-4.20 |     1
-4.20 |     2
-4.20 |     3
-4.20 |     4
-4.20 |     5
-4.20 |     6
-4.10 |     1
-4.10 |     2
-4.10 |     3
-4.10 |     4
-4.10 |     5
-4.10 |     6
-4.10 |     7
-4.10 |     8
-4.10 |     9
```

Let's enumerate the zscore observation.

```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE duplicate_val AS (
  SELECT *
    FROM normal_z_1M
   UNION ALL
  SELECT v.z AS z
        , v.freq - 1 AS freq
    FROM duplicate_val v
   INNER JOIN normal_z_1M w
      ON v.z = w.z
   WHERE v.freq > 1
)
SELECT  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY z, freq) AS ob_id
      , z
  FROM duplicate_val
 ORDER BY ob_id;
```

```console
ob_id |   z
------+-------
    1 |  -4.8
    2 | -4.70
    3 | -4.60
    4 | -4.50
    5 | -4.40
    6 | -4.40
    7 | -4.40
    8 | -4.30
    9 | -4.30
   10 | -4.30
   11 | -4.30
   12 | -4.20
   13 | -4.20
   14 | -4.20
   15 | -4.20
   16 | -4.20
   17 | -4.20
   18 | -4.10
   19 | -4.10
   20 | -4.10
   21 | -4.10
   22 | -4.10
   23 | -4.10
   24 | -4.10
   25 | -4.10
   26 | -4.10
```

Let's create a view of the previous query.

```SQL
CREATE VIEW normal_z_1M_obs AS (
WITH RECURSIVE duplicate_val AS (
  SELECT *
    FROM normal_z_1M
   UNION ALL
  SELECT v.z AS z
        , v.freq - 1 AS freq
    FROM duplicate_val v
   INNER JOIN normal_z_1M w
      ON v.z = w.z
   WHERE v.freq > 1
)
SELECT  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY z, freq) AS ob_id
      , z
  FROM duplicate_val
 ORDER BY ob_id
);
```

Now we have `1,000,000` zscore samples.

```console
dvdrental=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM normal_z_1M_obs;
  count
---------
 1000000
(1 row)
```

Let's check the mean and standard deviation.

```SQL
SELECT ROUND(AVG(z),2) AS mean
     , ROUND(STDDEV_POP(z),2) AS std_p
  FROM normal_z_1M_obs;
```

```console
mean | std_p
-----+-------
0.00 |  1.00
```

2. Randomly select an observation from a standard normal distribution with a mean zero and standard deviation  of 1 and square the result. The result squared is an observation from a `chi-square` distribution with `1` degree of freedom.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
)
SELECT (SELECT rw_nm FROM samples)
      , ob_id
      , z
      , ROUND(POWER(z,2),2) AS chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_z_1M_obs
WHERE ob_id = (SELECT rw_nm FROM samples);
```

```console
rw_nm  | ob_id  |  z   | chi_sq_x
-------+--------+------+----------
871692 | 871692 | 1.10 |     1.21
```

3. Now let's repeat this 1000 times and make a histogram:

First, generate `1000` random values in the range `[1 1,000,000]`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,1000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT *
  FROM samples
 ORDER BY id;
```

```console
id  | rw_nm
----+--------
  1 | 750899
  2 | 807822
  3 | 317935
  4 |  88451
  5 | 295362
  6 | 316929
  7 | 138962
  8 | 421594
  9 | 775450
 10 | 157827
 11 | 435657
 12 | 506378
 13 | 684846
 14 | 332414
 15 | 176097
 16 | 726721
 17 | 104039
 18 | 836660
 19 | 652705
 20 | 925271
```

Next, randomly select `with replacement` 1000 observations from a standard normal distribution and squared the result.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,1000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT  ob_id
      , z
      , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
INNER JOIN samples s
   ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
ORDER BY chi_sq_x,z,ob_id;
```

```console
ob_id  |   z   | chi_sq_x

Let's save the `chi-square` distribution with one degree of freedom.

```SQL

Let's count the values' frequency.

## Problem 2: Simulating random chi-square variables 2 DOF

Let's study the case of `v=2`.

- X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub>

Randomly select two observations from a standard normal distribution with a mean zero and standard deviation  of 1. Next, square each value and sum them all up. The result is an observation from a `chi-square` distribution with `2` degree of freedom.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  UNION ALL
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
),
sampling AS (
  SELECT  z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2),2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs
  WHERE ob_id IN (SELECT rw_nm FROM samples)
)
SELECT  z
      , chi_sq_x
      , SUM(chi_sq_x) OVER () AS chi_sq_x_dof2
 FROM sampling;
```

```console
z    | chi_sq_x | chi_sq_x_dof2
-----+----------+---------------
0.80 |     0.64 |          1.85
1.10 |     1.21 |          1.85
```

- Now let's repeat this 1000 times and make a histogram:

First, generate `2000` random values in the range `[1 1,000,000]`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,2000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT *
  FROM samples
 ORDER BY id;
```

Next, randomly select `with replacement` 2000 observations from a standard normal distribution and squared the result.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,2000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT  s.id
      , z
      , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
INNER JOIN samples s
   ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
ORDER BY id;
```

```console
id  |   z   | chi_sq_x
----+-------+----------
  1 | -0.10 |     0.01
  2 |  0.10 |     0.01
  3 |  0.40 |     0.16
  4 | -0.20 |     0.04
  5 | -0.40 |     0.16
  6 |  0.80 |     0.64
  7 |  0.00 |     0.00
  8 |  1.10 |     1.21
  9 |  0.40 |     0.16
 10 | -0.20 |     0.04
 11 | -0.10 |     0.01
 12 | -1.90 |     3.61
 13 |  1.60 |     2.56
 14 |  0.90 |     0.81
 15 | -2.10 |     4.41
 16 | -0.70 |     0.49
 17 | -0.20 |     0.04
 18 | -0.40 |     0.16
 19 |  0.00 |     0.00
 20 |  0.80 |     0.64
 21 | -0.60 |     0.36
 22 |  1.40 |     1.96
```

Next, partition the table rows in 1000 groups of two samples.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,2000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
)
SELECT  NTILE (1000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
      , id
      , z
      , chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_sampling
ORDER BY id;
```

```console
grp  |  id  |   z   | chi_sq_x
-----+------+-------+----------
   1 |    1 |  0.10 |     0.01
   1 |    2 |  0.10 |     0.01
   2 |    3 | -1.60 |     2.56
   2 |    4 |  0.10 |     0.01
   3 |    5 | -1.90 |     3.61
   3 |    6 |  0.60 |     0.36
   4 |    7 |  1.60 |     2.56
   4 |    8 | -0.30 |     0.09
   5 |    9 |  0.00 |     0.00
   5 |   10 |  3.60 |    12.96
   6 |   11 | -0.80 |     0.64
   6 |   12 | -0.50 |     0.25
   7 |   13 | -1.30 |     1.69
   7 |   14 | -0.60 |     0.36
   8 |   15 | -0.10 |     0.01
   8 |   16 | -0.90 |     0.81
   9 |   17 |  0.10 |     0.01
   9 |   18 | -0.50 |     0.25
  10 |   19 | -1.30 |     1.69
  10 |   20 | -0.70 |     0.49
  11 |   21 |  0.20 |     0.04
  11 |   22 | -1.20 |     1.44
  12 |   23 | -0.60 |     0.36
  12 |   24 |  1.20 |     1.44
```

Next, sum the last column values for each group `grp`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,2000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
),
grouping_samples AS (
  SELECT  NTILE (1000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
        , chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_sampling
)
SELECT  grp AS id
      , SUM(chi_sq_x) AS chi_sq_x_dof2
 FROM grouping_samples
GROUP BY grp
ORDER BY chi_sq_x_dof2;
```

```console
id  | chi_sq_x_dof2
----+---------------
320 |          0.00
772 |          0.00

Now, we have a table with `1000` chi-square random variables with two dof.

Let's create a table with the random variables.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE chi_squared_dof2 AS (

  SELECT  t.id AS id

WITH diff AS (

```

```console

Let's count the values' frequency.

```SQL

Let's plot the histogram:


```SQL

  SELECT chi_sq_x_dof2 AS chi_sq_x

               THEN 1
               WHEN FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER = CEIL(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER
               THEN (FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER - 1) + 1
               ELSE FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER + 1
          END AS id
         ,CASE WHEN chi_sq_x <= 1
              THEN '(0 1]'
              WHEN FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER = CEIL(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER
              THEN '(' || (FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER - 1)::TEXT || ' ' ||  (FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER)::TEXT || ']'
              ELSE '(' || (FLOOR(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER)::TEXT || ' ' || (CEIL(chi_sq_x)::INTEGER)::TEXT || ']'
          END AS bin
        , chi_sq_x
        , cnt
    FROM chi_squared_cnt
),
histogram AS (
  SELECT   id

   GROUP BY id, bin
)
SELECT   id

       , LPAD('*',ROUND((freq/10.0)::NUMERIC,0)::INTEGER ,'*') AS freq_plot

## Problem 3: Simulating random chi-square variables 3 DOF

Let's study the case of `v=3`.

- X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>

Randomly select three observations from a standard normal distribution with a mean zero and standard deviation  of 1. Next, square each value and sum them all up. The result is an observation from a `chi-square` distribution with `3` degree of freedom.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  UNION ALL
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  UNION ALL
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
),
sampling AS (
  SELECT  z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2),2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs
  WHERE ob_id IN (SELECT rw_nm FROM samples)
)
SELECT  z
      , chi_sq_x
      , SUM(chi_sq_x) OVER () AS chi_sq_x_dof3
 FROM sampling;
```

```console
z    | chi_sq_x | chi_sq_x_dof3
-----+----------+---------------
0.60 |     0.36 |          1.81
0.80 |     0.64 |          1.81
0.90 |     0.81 |          1.81
```

- Now let's repeat this 1000 times and make a histogram:

First, generate `3000` random values in the range `[1 1,000,000]`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,3000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT *
  FROM samples
 ORDER BY id;
```

Next, randomly select `with replacement` 3000 observations from a standard normal distribution and squared the result.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,3000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT  s.id
      , z
      , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
INNER JOIN samples s
   ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
ORDER BY id;
```

```console
id  |   z   | chi_sq_x
----+-------+----------
  1 | -1.20 |     1.44
  2 | -0.20 |     0.04
  3 |  1.40 |     1.96
  4 | -2.20 |     4.84
  5 | -0.90 |     0.81
  6 | -1.80 |     3.24
  7 | -1.50 |     2.25
  8 |  2.10 |     4.41
  9 |  0.90 |     0.81
 10 |  1.10 |     1.21
 11 |  0.30 |     0.09
 12 | -1.30 |     1.69
 13 |  0.20 |     0.04
 14 |  1.30 |     1.69
 15 |  0.00 |     0.00
```

Next, partition the table rows in 1000 groups of three samples each.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,3000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
)
SELECT  NTILE (1000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
      , id
      , z
      , chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_sampling
ORDER BY id;
```

```console
grp  |  id  |   z   | chi_sq_x
-----+------+-------+----------
   1 |    1 | -1.80 |     3.24
   1 |    2 |  2.10 |     4.41
   1 |    3 |  1.30 |     1.69
   2 |    4 |  1.00 |     1.00
   2 |    5 |  0.10 |     0.01
   2 |    6 | -0.30 |     0.09
   3 |    7 |  1.30 |     1.69
   3 |    8 |  0.40 |     0.16
   3 |    9 | -0.40 |     0.16
   4 |   10 |  1.10 |     1.21
   4 |   11 |  0.50 |     0.25
   4 |   12 | -0.30 |     0.09
   5 |   13 | -0.20 |     0.04
   5 |   14 |  1.50 |     2.25
   5 |   15 |  0.20 |     0.04
   6 |   16 |  1.50 |     2.25
   6 |   17 |  0.70 |     0.49
   6 |   18 |  0.50 |     0.25
   7 |   19 | -0.70 |     0.49
   7 |   20 | -1.70 |     2.89
   7 |   21 | -0.20 |     0.04
   8 |   22 | -0.30 |     0.09
```

Next, sum the last column values for each group `grp`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,3000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
),
grouping_samples AS (
  SELECT  NTILE (1000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
        , chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_sampling
)
SELECT  grp AS id
      , SUM(chi_sq_x) AS chi_sq_x_dof3
 FROM grouping_samples
GROUP BY grp
ORDER BY chi_sq_x_dof3;
```

```console
id  | chi_sq_x_dof3
----+---------------
324 |          0.02
758 |          0.02
166 |          0.05
474 |          0.05
 39 |          0.05
815 |          0.05
742 |          0.05
  3 |          0.05
218 |          0.06
475 |          0.06
523 |          0.08
302 |          0.08
278 |          0.09
469 |          0.10
718 |          0.11
470 |          0.13
839 |          0.13
 84 |          0.13
399 |          0.14
972 |          0.14
 96 |          0.16
225 |          0.17
```

Now, we have a table with `1000` chi-square random variables with three dof.

Let's create a table with the random variables.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE chi_squared_dof3 AS (
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm

),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm

WITH diff AS (

```

```console

1000 |   2.28 | 2.91 |       2.46 |             1.68 |    3.95
```

Let's count the values' frequency.

```SQL

## Problem 4: Simulating random chi-square variables 4 DOF

Let's study the case of `v=4`.

- X<sup>2</sup> = X<sup>2</sup><sub>1</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>2</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub> + X<sup>2</sup><sub>4</sub>

Randomly select four observations from a standard normal distribution with a mean zero and standard deviation  of 1. Next, square each value and sum them all up. The result is an observation from a `chi-square` distribution with `4` degree of freedom.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  UNION ALL
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  UNION ALL
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  UNION ALL
  SELECT FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
),
sampling AS (
  SELECT  z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2),2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs
  WHERE ob_id IN (SELECT rw_nm FROM samples)
)
SELECT  z
      , chi_sq_x
      , SUM(chi_sq_x) OVER () AS chi_sq_x_dof4
 FROM sampling;
```

```console
z     | chi_sq_x | chi_sq_x_dof4
------+----------+---------------
-2.30 |     5.29 |          7.03
0.10  |     0.01 |          7.03
0.20  |     0.04 |          7.03
1.30  |     1.69 |          7.03
```

- Now let's repeat this 1000 times and make a histogram:

First, generate `4000` random values in the range `[1 1,000,000]`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,4000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT *
  FROM samples
 ORDER BY id;
```

Next, randomly select `with replacement` 4000 observations from a standard normal distribution and squared the result.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,4000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
)
SELECT  s.id
      , z
      , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
INNER JOIN samples s
   ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
ORDER BY id;
```

```console
id  |   z   | chi_sq_x
----+-------+----------
  1 | -0.50 |     0.25
  2 | -0.20 |     0.04
  3 |  0.80 |     0.64
  4 |  0.50 |     0.25
  5 |  1.10 |     1.21
  6 | -0.70 |     0.49
  7 | -1.40 |     1.96
  8 | -1.30 |     1.69
  9 |  0.30 |     0.09
 10 |  0.50 |     0.25
```

Next, partition the table rows in 1000 groups of four samples each.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,4000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
)
SELECT  NTILE (1000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
      , id
      , z
      , chi_sq_x
 FROM normal_sampling
ORDER BY id;
```

```console
grp  |  id  |   z   | chi_sq_x
-----+------+-------+----------
   1 |    1 | -0.60 |     0.36
   1 |    2 | -0.20 |     0.04
   1 |    3 |  0.00 |     0.00
   1 |    4 |  0.50 |     0.25
   2 |    5 |  1.40 |     1.96
   2 |    6 | -0.30 |     0.09
   2 |    7 | -0.20 |     0.04
   2 |    8 | -0.20 |     0.04
   3 |    9 | -0.30 |     0.09
   3 |   10 | -0.50 |     0.25
   3 |   11 |  0.90 |     0.81
   3 |   12 |  1.10 |     1.21
```

Next, sum the last column values for each group `grp`.

```SQL
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm
  FROM (SELECT *
          FROM GENERATE_SERIES(1,4000) AS id, (SELECT 1 AS rw_nm) x ) t
),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_z_1M_obs nz
  INNER JOIN samples s
     ON nz.ob_id = s.rw_nm
),
grouping_samples AS (
  SELECT  NTILE (1000) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS grp
        , chi_sq_x
   FROM normal_sampling
)
SELECT  grp AS id
      , SUM(chi_sq_x) AS chi_sq_x_dof4
 FROM grouping_samples
GROUP BY grp
ORDER BY chi_sq_x_dof4;
```

```console
id  | chi_sq_x_dof4
----+---------------
917 |          0.23
287 |          0.24
900 |          0.29
504 |          0.31
831 |          0.33
170 |          0.34
308 |          0.34
581 |          0.35
983 |          0.37
 32 |          0.41
183 |          0.42
977 |          0.42
542 |          0.43
471 |          0.43
573 |          0.44
389 |          0.45
691 |          0.45
 23 |          0.45
```

Now, we have a table with `1000` chi-square random variables with four dof.

Let's create a table with the random variables.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE chi_squared_dof4 AS (
WITH samples AS (
  SELECT  t.id AS id
        , t.rw_nm * FLOOR(RANDOM()*1000000)::INTEGER + 1 AS rw_nm

),
normal_sampling AS (
  SELECT  s.id AS id
        , z
        , ROUND(POWER(z,2)::NUMERIC,2) AS chi_sq_x

        , SUM(chi_sq_x) AS chi_sq_x_dof4
   FROM grouping_samples
  GROUP BY grp
)
SELECT chi_sq_x_dof4
  FROM chi_sq_samples
);

WITH diff AS (
  SELECT chi_sq_x_dof4 AS x
       , COUNT(chi_sq_x_dof4) OVER() AS n
       , AVG(chi_sq_x_dof4) OVER() AS mean

       , POWER(std_p,4) AS den_krt
    FROM diff
   GROUP BY n, mean, std, std_p

```

```console

1000 |   3.30 | 3.99 |       2.86 |             1.45 |    3.10

Let's plot the histogram:
