# Intro To Logical Operators

In the next concepts, you will be learning about Logical Operators. Logical Operators include:

- **LIKE**: This allows you to perform operations similar to using `WHERE` and `=`, but for cases when **you might not know exactly what you are looking for**.
- **IN**: This allows you to perform operations similar to using `WHERE` and `=`, but for **more than one condition**.
- **NOT**: This is used with `IN` and `LIKE` to **select all of the rows** `NOT LIKE` or `NOT IN` a certain condition.
- **AND** & **BETWEEN**: These allow you to **combine operations** where **all combined conditions must be true**.
- **OR**: This allows you to **combine operations** where **at least one of the combined conditions must be true**.

Don't worry if this doesn't make total sense right now. You will get practice with each in the next sections.
